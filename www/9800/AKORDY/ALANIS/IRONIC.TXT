                      Ironic - Alanis Morissette

                  From the album, "Jagged Little Pill"
    
                  Words and music by Alanis Morissette           
       
               -------------------------------------------

                [Laboriously typed up by Mardi Gras(TNT)]


Notes:  If there are spacing errors...  That's because I didn't type all         this up on a PC or Mac!  Requires a minimum of 2 guitars.  Guitar 1         plays the intro rhythm where required and the sections where the         chords are shown above the lyrics.  Guitar 2 handles all the rhythm         figures and adds the boost in the song by accompanying Guitar 1         with some of the chords in the chorus sections.  Ideally, Guitar 1         should be acoustic and Guitar 2 should have a switch between a soft         neck postion sound and distortion.
        The chords in verse 1 are to be played really softly and smoothly,         almost sweep picking the strings.  In verse 3, Guitar 1 plays the         chords shown, but this time adding a lot of palm muting between         chord changes (listen to the track).  Later on in verse 3, on the         part where "And isn't it ironic...  etc..." is sung, Guitar 1         arpeggiates the chords instead of just strumming the chords (again,         listen to the track).

                                 (Rhy Fig 6)
         And life has a funny way of helping you out when you think

Verse 3:  (Play Rhy Fig 7 throughout)
         
            F#      B                F#      G#m
          A traffic jam when you are already late


               F#      B            F#        G#m
          A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break


                    F#           B                   F#        G#m
          It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife


          (No instruments on these last two lines)         
          
          It's like meeting the man of my dreams

          And then meeting his beautiful wife

          (Bongo drums Fill-in)
 


                        F#    B             F#     G#m
          And isn't it ironic...  Don't you think?


                    F#    B                  F#        G#m
           A little too ironic...  And yeah I really do think...



Chorus:  (Repeat chorus as before)



       

Coda:  (Play the intro 1 rhythm throughout this part)

       Life has a funny way of sneaking up on you

       Life has a funny, funny way of helping you out...  Helping you out

       (Cymbals and ending on guitars)

       (I suggest you end on the intro 2 rhythm s-l-o-w-l-y)


    That's about it for Ironic.  There is only so much that can be explained in words.  I suggest you just listen to the track.  The song itself is fairly easy and sounds great when played with a band.  I'm fairly sure that what I have tabbed out is accurate to the track on the album.  There may be small errors here and there, so corrections are all welcome.
