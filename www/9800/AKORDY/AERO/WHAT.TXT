  Intro: G D4 Em7 D C

G                                      D
There goes my old girlfriend, there's another diamond ring.
         Em                        D     C
And, uh, all those late night promises I guess they don't mean a thing.
   G                           D 
So baby what's the story? Did you  find another man ?
      Em
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
 D         C                                                   D 
  When you don't look back I guess the feeling starts to fade away.
  G                                    Em
I used to feel your fire but now it's cold inside.
 D           C
  And you're back on the street like you didn't miss a beat, yeah.

life to the toss of the dice?,  Tell me what it takes to let you go,  yeah.

Girl before I met you I was F.I.N.E, fine
But your love made me a prisoner, yeah my heart's been doing time.
You spent me up like money then you hung me out to dry.
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise,
'Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes.

 Tell me what it takes . . .

C                                               G

  Yeah, tell me that is better when you're all alone.
  Fm                              D#    C#
  Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch.
                                           G#
  Tell me that my loving didn't mean that much.
                                               C
  Tell me you ain't dying when you're crying for me.
 A#
  Tell me what it takes to let you . . .
 . . . everything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice.
  A#                C#                    F
  Tell me who's to blame for thinking twice.    No, no no no.

 A#                    C#            F       Dm
  'Cause I don't wanna burn in paradise.    Oh
 A#                       F
  Let go, let go, let go  I don't wanna burn in paradise.
