{title:Country Roads}
{st:John Denver}

Almos[D]t heaven, Wes[Bm]t Virginia,
Blue[A] Ridge Mountains, Shen[G]andoah Ri[D]ver.
Life is old there, ol[Bm]der than the trees,
Yo[A]unger than the mountains, blo[G]wing like a br[D]eeze.

{c:Chorus:}
     Count[D]ry road, take me h[A]ome
     To the pl[Bm]ace I be[G]long,
     West Virg[D]inia, mountain mo[A]mma,
     Take me h[G]ome, country r[D]oad.

All my m[D]em'ries ga[Bm]ther 'round her,
Mi[A]ner's lady, str[G]anger to blue wa[D]ter.
Dark and dusty, pai[Bm]nted on the sky,
Mi[A]sty taste of moonshine, te[G]ar-drop in my e[D]ye.

     {c:Chorus.}

I h[Bm]ear her vo[A]ice, in the mor[D]ning hours she calls me,
The ra[G]dio reminds [D]me of my h[A]ome far away.
And dri[Bm]ving down the r[Em]oad I get the f[G]eeling
That I sh[D]ould have been home yes[A]terday, yes[A7]terday.

     {c:Chorus.}
