Adams : Please forgive me

	   E			       A       A5  A
It still feels like our first night together
E			Fm#
Feels like the first kiss and it's getting better, baby
E	   D
No one can better this
A					  E	A
You're still holding on, you're still the one
			   Db			Fm#
The first time our eyes met, same feeling I get
			   Db			      A
Only it feels much stronger, I wanna love you longer
			E
You still turn the fire on


Bridge:

   A	      Fm#     A	     D	    
So if you're feeling lonely, don't
E			   A
You're the only one I ever want
       Fm#    A	     D
I only wanna make it go
E			  Fm#	      D
So if I love you a little more than I should...

Please forgive me, I know not what I do
