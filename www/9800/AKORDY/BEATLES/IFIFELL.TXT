Title:				IF I FELL			(Beatles)

		     Ebm
		If I fell in love with you
		          D
		Would you promise to be true
		         Db Bbm
		And help me understand
		            Ebm
		'Cause I've been in love before 
		    D
		And found that love is more
		     Em           A
		Than just holding hands

		     D    Em F#m      Em
		If I give my heart to you
		  A                     D  Em F#m
		I must be sure from the very  start
		     Em        A                 D   Em  A
		That you would love me more than her

		     D     Em F#m
		If I trust in you
		   Em            A
		Oh please, don't run and hide
		      D   Em  F#m
		If I love you too
		   Em            A                  D9
		Oh please, don't hurt my pride like her
		                           G
		Cause I couldn't stand the pain
		    Gm                        D           A7
		And I would be sad if our new love was in vain


		     D    Em     F#m
		So I hope you'll see 
		     Em      A     
		That I would love to love you
		D   Em   F#m      Em
		And that she will cry
		     A                 D
		When she learns we are two
		     Gm      C         D
		If I fell in love with you
