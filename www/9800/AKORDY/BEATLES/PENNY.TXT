Penny [G]Lane: there is a [Em]barber showing [Am7]photographs[D7]
Of every [G]head he's had the [Em]pleasure to [Gm7]know.
And all the [Em7-5]people that come and [Eb]go
Stop and [D7]say hello.[C]

     Penny [F]Lane is in my ears and in [Am7]my ey[Bb]es.
     [F]Wet beneath the blue subur[Am7]ban sk[Bb]ies,
     I sit and [Cdim]meanwhile:[D7]

On the corner is a banker with a motor car.
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a "mac"
In the pouring rain.

     Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
     Wet beneath the blue suburban skies,
     I sit and meanwhile:

Back in Penny Lane: there is a fireman with an hourglass.
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.

     Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
     Wet beneath the blue suburban skies,
     I sit and meanwhile:

Back in Penny Lane: the barber shaves another customer.
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trend.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain.

     Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
     Wet beneath the blue suburban skies,
     I sit and meanwhile back:

     Penny [G]Lane is in my ears and in [Bm7]my e[C]yes.
     [G]Wet beneath the blue subur[Bm7]ban sk[C]ies.
