{title:Nowhere Man}
{st:John Lennon/Paul McCartney}
[C]He's a real [G]nowhere man,
[F]Sitting in his [C]nowhere land,
[F]Making all his [Fm]nowhere plans for [F]nobo[C]dy.[Bb]     [F]    [C]

[C]Doesn't have a [G]point of view,
[F]Knows not where he's [G]going to,
[F]Isn't he a [Fm]bit like you and [F]me?[C]

     Nowhere m[Em]an, please [F]listen,
     You don't [Em]know what you're [F]missing,
     Nowhere [Em]man, the [F]world is at your comman[G7]d.

He's as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere man can you see me at all?

Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

     Nowhere man, don't worry,
     Take your time, don't hurry,
     Leave it all 'till somebody else lends you a hand.

He's a real nowhere man,
Sitting in his nowhere land,
[F]Making all his [Fm]nowhere plans for [F]nobo[C]dy.
[F]Making all his [Fm]nowhere plans for [C]nobody.
