   E              A           F#m7        B7
If you wear red tonight
   E                       A              D6      B7
Remember what I said tonight
        C#m                                 A
For red is the colour that my baby wore
  D                            C#m
And what's more, it's true
 E
Yes it is


Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Everybody knows I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand, it's true
  E                 E7
Yes it is, it's true

Yes it is

Bm              E7                 A        F#m
I could be happy with you by my side
Bm               E7            C#m
If I could forget her, but it's my pride

Yes it is, yes it is
             F#7    B7
Oh, yes it is, yeah


Please don't wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the colour that will make me blue
         D                  C#m
In spite of you, it's true
   E7                G#
Yes it is, it's true

Yes it is

 Bm               E7                 A          F#m
I could be happy with you by my side
Bm              E7             C#m 
If I could forget her, but it's my pride

Yes it is, yes it is
              F#7       B7
Oh, yes it is, yeah

Please don't wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the colour that will make me blue
  D                       C#m
In spite of you, it's true
     E                                                    
Yes it is, it's true
