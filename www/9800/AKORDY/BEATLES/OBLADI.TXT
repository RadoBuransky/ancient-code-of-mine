{t:Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da}
{st:John Lennon and Paul McCartney}

[G]Desmond had a barrow in the [D7]market place, 
Molly is the singer in a [G]band.
Desmond says to [G7]Molly, girl I [C]like your face 
and Molly [G]says this as she [D7]takes him by the [G]hand.

{start_of_chorus}
Ob-la-[G]di, ob-la-da, life goes [Bm]on      [Em]bra.
[G]La la how the [D7]life goes [G]on. (repeat)
{end_of_chorus}

[G]Desmond takes a trolley to the [D7]jeweller's store, 
buys a twenty carat golden [G]ring.
Takes it back to [G7]Molly, waiting [C]at the door 
and as he [G]gives it to her [D7]she begins to [G]sing.

{c: chorus}

[NC]In a couple of [C]years they have built a home sweet [G]home
[NC]with a couple of [C]kids running in the yard
of [G]Desmond and Molly [D7]Jones.

[G]Happy ever after in the [D7]market place,
Desmond lets the children lend a [G]hand.
Molly stays at [G7]home and does her [C]pretty face 
and in the [G]evening she still [D7]sings it with the [G]band.
