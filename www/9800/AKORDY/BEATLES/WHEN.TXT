[G]When I get older, losing my hair, many years from [D7]now,
will you still be senting me a Valentine, birthday greetings, [G]bottle of wine?
If I'd been out 'till quarter to three, [G7]would you lock the [C]door?
Will you still [Eb7]need me, [G]will you still [E7]feed me, [A7]when
I'm [D7]sixty-[G]four?

{soc}
[Em]Hmm------[D]mmm------[Em]mmmh.
[Em]You'll be older, [B7]too. 
[Em]Aaah, and if you [Am]say the word, [C]I could [D7]stay with [G]you.

I could be handy, mending a fuse, when your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside, sunday mornings, go for a ride.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?

{soc}
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight if it's not to dear. 
We shall scrimp and save.
Ah, grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck, and Dave.
{eoc}

Send me a postcard, drop me a line stating point of view.
Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away.
Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?
