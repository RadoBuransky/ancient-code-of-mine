1.   [F]I'd like to be [Dm]under the sea
     In an [Bb]Octopus's [F]Garden in the s[C7]hade.
     [F]He'd let us in, [Dm]knows where we've been,
     In his [Bb]Octopus's [F]Garden in the s[C7]hade.

     [Dm]I'd ask my friends to come and see
     [Bb]An Octopus's [C]Garden with me.
     [F]I'd like to be [Dm]under the sea
     In an [Bb]Octopus's [C7]Garden in the s[F]hade.


2.   We would be warm below the storm
     In our little hideaway beneath the waves.
     Resting our head on the sea bed
     In an Octopus's Garden near a cave.

     We would sing and dance around
     Because we know we can't be found.
     I'd like to be under the sea
     In an Octopus's Garden in the shade.


3.   We would shout and swim about
     The coral that lies beneath the waves.
     Oh, what joy for every girl and boy
     Knowing they're happy and they're safe.

     We would be so happy, you and me.
     No one there to tell us what to do.
     I'd like to be under the sea
     In an Octopus's Garden with you.
