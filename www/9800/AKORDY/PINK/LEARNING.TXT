LEARNING TO FLY
Pink Floyd
(Gilmour, Moore, Ezrin, Carin)

G  A/G  G  Gmaj7  Em7  D

G              A/G   G         Gmaj7
Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Em7                                       D
Stretched to the point of no turning back
G              A/G     G         Gmaj7
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Em7                              D
Standing alone my senses reeled
G                A/G  G           Gmaj7
A fatal attraction is holding me fast, how
Em7                                    D
Can I escape this irresistible grasp?

C                  Em/B        Am         G
Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
F                               C           D
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I
G  A/G  G  Gmaj7

G          A/G        G          Gmaj7
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Em7                                         D
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
G          A/G  G              Gmaj7
No navigator to guide my way home
Em7                                  D
Unladened, empty and turned to stone

C              Em/B      Am               G
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
F                           C
Condition grounded but determined to try
                   Em/B        Am           G
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
F                               C           D
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

F  Am7  D9  D

G
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,
Em7
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air,
G
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Em7
Out of the corner of my watering eye
G
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Em7
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

C                 Em/B  Am                 G
There's no sensation to compare with this
   F                   C
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
                   Em/B        Am          G
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
F                               C           D
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

G  A/G  G  Gmaj7  Em7  D
