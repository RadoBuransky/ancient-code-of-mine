ONE SLIP
Pink Floyd
(Gilmour, Manzanera)

Eb                            Gm(add4)
A restless eye across a weary room
Eb                                       Fsus4
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
    C                                              Eb6  Eb
The music played and played as we whirled without end
F                       Ab(add9)
No hint, no word her honour to defend

Eb                                Gm(add4)
I will, I will she sighed to my request
                 Eb                                             Fsus4 F Fsus4
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
     C                                       Eb
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire, I lead the way to the funeral pyre
        F
And without a thought of the consequence, I gave into my decadence

C(add9)                          Ebmaj7/Bb
One slip, and down the hole we fall
   Bb(add9)                  Gm(add9)
It seems to take no time at all
  C(add9)                            Ebmaj7/Bb
A momentary lapse of reason, that binds a life for life
    Bb(add9)                               Gm(add9)
A small regret, you won't forget, there'll be no sleep in here tonight.

Eb  Gm/D  Gm  Eb  Gm/D  Gm

Eb                                       Gm(add4)
Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?
              Eb                                              Fsus4  F  Fsus4
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
    C                                         Eb
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
    F
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone
C(add9)                          Ebmaj7/Bb
One slip, and down the hole we fall.
   Bb(add9)                  Gm(add9)
It seems to take no time at all
  C(add9)                            Ebmaj7/Bb
A momentary lapse of reason, that binds life to a life
    Bb(add9)                                   Gm(add9)
The one regret you will never forget, there'll be no sleep in here tonight
