{t:Lady In Black}
{st:Uriah Heep}

She [Am]came to me one morning, one lonely Sunday morning,
her [G]long hair flowing in the [Am]mid-winter wind.
I [Am]know not how she found me, for in darkness I was walking,
and [G]destruction lay around me from a [Am]fight I could not win.

[Am]Ahahaaah[G]aahah, [Am]ahahaaa[G]haha[Am]ha !

She [Am]asked me name my foe then.  I said the need within some men
to [G]fight and kill their brothers without thought of men or god.
And [Am]I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies,
so [G]eager was my passion to [Am]devour this waste of life.

[Am]Ahahaaah[G]aahah, [Am]ahahaaa[G]haha[Am]ha !

But [Am]she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals,
so [G]easy to begin and yet impossible to end.
For [Am]she the mother of all men had counciled me so wisely that
I [G]feared to walk alone again and [Am]asked if she would stay.

[Am]Ahahaaah[G]aahah, [Am]ahahaaa[G]haha[Am]ha !

"Oh [Am]lady lend your hand," I cried, "Oh let me rest here at your side."
"Have [G]faith and trust in me," she said and filled my heart with life.
There [Am]is no strength in numbers.  I've no such misconceptions.
But [G]when you need me be [Am]assured I won't be far away.

[Am]Ahahaaah[G]aahah, [Am]ahahaaa[G]haha[Am]ha !

Thus [Am]having spoke she turned away and though I found no words to say
I [G]stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear.
My [Am]labor is no easier, but now I know I'm not alone.
I [G]find new heart each time I [Am]think upon that windy day.
And [Am]if one day she comes to you drink deeply
 from her words so wise.
Take [G]courage from her as your prize and [Am]say hello for me.

[Am]Ahahaaah[G]aahah, [Am]ahahaaa[G]haha[Am]ha !
