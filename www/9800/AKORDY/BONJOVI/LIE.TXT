Verzia 2:

I know I promised baby, I would be the one to make our drams come true
I ain앖 too proud of all the struggles and the hard times we았e been through
When this cold world comes between us, please tell me you앏l be brave

앆ause I can realize the danger when forgiveness fades away

Verzia 3:

Pour another cup of coffee, babe I got something to say to you
I ain앖 got the winning ticket,
Not the one that압 gonna pull us through
No one said it앇 be easy, let your old man take you home
But know if you walk out on me
That darling, I앇 be gone

if you don앖 love me life to me
앆ause baby youre the one thing I believe
let it all fall down around us, if that압 what압 meant to be

A
it압 hard believing that the thrill is gone
G#m B
but we got to go around again, so let압 hold on

if you don앖 love me life to me
앆ause baby youre the one thing I believe
let it all fall down around us, if that압 what압 meant to be

baby i can take it
