Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies  Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say

Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman  

Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
A                                       E
He got the action, He got the motion    Yeah the boy can play
A                      E
Dedication, devotion   Turning all the night time into the day
E                                     B
