       {c:intro: Dm  Am  Dm G}

       O[G]h, li[Am]fe it's bigger,
       [Em]it's bigger that you and [Am]you are not me
       The lengths that I will [Em]go to,
       the distance in your e[Am]yes
       [Em]Oh no I've said too [Dm]much,
       I've said it a[G]ll
       That's me in the c[Am]orner,
       that's me in the s[Em]potlight,
       losing my r[Am]eligion
       Trying to k[Em]eep up with you
       and I [Am]don't know if I can do i[Em]t
       Oh no I've said too [Dm]much,
       I haven't said en[G]ough
       
       I thought that I heard you [F]laughing,
       I thought that I heard you [Am]sing[Am/B][Am/C][Am/E]
       I [F]think I thought I [Dm]saw you t[Am]ry


       Every whisper of every waking hour
       I'm choosing my confessions
       Trying to keep an eye on you
       Like a hurt lost and blinded foal, oh
       Oh no I've said too much, I said it all
       Consider this, consider this
       a hint of the century,
       Consider this, a slip that brought me to my knees, pale
       What if all these fantasies come flailing around
       Now I've said too much
       I thought that I heard you laughing,
       I thought that I heard you sing
       I think I thought I saw you try
       
       But [Am]That was just a dream
       [C]That was just a [G]dream
       
       That's me in the corner,
       that's me in the spotlight,
       losing my religion
       Trying to keep up with you
       and I don't know if I can do it
       Oh no I've said too much,
       I haven't said enough
       I thought that I heard you laughing,
       I thought that I heard you sing
       I think I thought I saw you try
       But That was just a dream
       Try, cry, fly, and try
       That was just a dream
       Just a dream
       Just a dream
       Dream
