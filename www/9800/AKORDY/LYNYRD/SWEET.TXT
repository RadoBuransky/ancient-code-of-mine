{t:Sweet Home Alabama}
{st:Lynyrd Skynyrd}

[D]   Big w[C]heels keep on [G]turning
[D]   Carry me [C]home to see my [G]kin.
[D]   Singing [C]songs about the [G]southland
[D]   I miss'ole' '[C]bamy once again[G] (and I think it's a sin)


Well, I heard Mister Young sing about her
Well, I heard ole Neil put her down.
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember,
A southern man don't need him around anyhow

{soc}
Sweet home Alabama, 
Where the skies are so blue,
Sweet home Alabama,
Lord, I'm coming home to you.
{eoc}
In Birmingham they love the Gov'nor   B[F]oo  h[C]oo  h[D]oo !
Now we all did what we could do.
Now Watergate does not bother me.
Does your conscience bother you?  (tell the truth)

{c:CHORUS}

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a tune or two
Lord they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
Now how about you?

{c:CHORUS}
