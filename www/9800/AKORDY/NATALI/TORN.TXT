                          Torn - Natalie Imbruglia                 
                       -----------------------------

                              *Single Version*

                         [Transcribed by TNT SHWE]



Notes: 

          Play the rhythm acoustically and the lead section (reminiscent
of the lead sections from James' "She's A Star") in the Coda electrically. 
I could tell you what the settings are, but since all amps differ, it
would be a better idea to go and tra in yourself to find these settings
yourself!  The chords in brackets are the transition chords and are played
for a much shorter period than the chords out of brackets.  Transition
chords are used to "musically fuse" two chords together!

Intro: 

          F   Bb   F   Gm



Verse 1:

          F                                      Am
            I thought I saw a man brought to life

                                                     Bb
            He was warm, he came around like he was dignified

       
            He showed me what it was to cry

          F                                       Am
            Well you couldn't be that man I adored

                   
            You don't seem to know 

                                         Bb
            Don't seem to care what your heart is for 


            But I don't know him anymore 



Pre Chorus 1:

                         Dm
                 There's nothing where he used to lie 

                C 
                 My conversation has run dry 

               Am
                 That's what's going on 

               C                       
                 Nothing's fine

                       F 
                 I'm torn



Chorus 1:

          (F)                    C                Dm
             I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel

                               Bb                         F
             I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor 

                               C                      Dm
                Illusion never changed, into something real 

                                Bb                              F
             I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn

                              C                  Dm  (C)  Bb
             You're a little late, I'm already torn 



Verse 2:

          F                                      Am
            So I guess the fortune teller's right

                                                                Bb
            I should have seen just what was there and not some holy light

  
            But you crawl beneath my veins and now
  


Pre Chorus 2:                          

                (Same chords and rhythm as Pre Chorus 1)


                 I don't care, I have no luck

                 I don't miss it all that much 

                 There's just so many things

                 That I can't touch

                 I'm torn



Chorus 2:

            (Same as Chorus 1)



Bridge:

             Dm  (C)  Bb       Dm            F         C
           Torn...             Ooooh...  Hoo ooooh...  Ooooh



Pre Chorus 3:

                (Same chords and rhythm as Pre Choruses 1 and 2)


                 There's nothing where he used to lie

                 My inspiration has run dry

                 That's what's going on

                 Nothing's right

                 I'm torn



Chorus 3:

          (F)                    C                Dm
             I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel

                               Bb                         F
             I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor 

                               C                      Dm
             Illusion never changed, into something real 

                                Bb                              F
             I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn

                                 C                Dm    
             I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel

                               Bb                              F
             I'm cold and I am shamed, bound and broken on the floor

                              C                  Dm  (C)  Bb
             You're a little late, I'm already torn 



Outro:

          Dm   C
          Torn...  [much wailing]           


          Ooh...



Outro/Solo:

              (Same rhythm as Choruses)  [To Fade]

This a Fantastic Song.  I have listenend to this track repeatedly and I 
feel that this is pretty close, I have limited knowledge of Chords, so 
the Build-Up is no doubt using Chords, If so, please contact me and tell 
me what they are.
