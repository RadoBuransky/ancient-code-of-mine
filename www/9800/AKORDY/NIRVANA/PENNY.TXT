Pennyroyal Tea
from Nirvana *In Utero*
Music and words by Kurt Cobain
Transcribed by Robert Wolsey

Tune down 1/2-step:  Eb Ab Db Gb Bb Eb

NOTE: These are the chords you are pretending to play; the 
actual chords that come out are a half-step lower because of 
the tuning.  Play A-barre chords on the chorus.


Am                 G
Im on my time with everyone

Am              G
I have very bad posture

C             D          A# 
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea

C                D               A#
Distill the life thats inside of me

C             D          A#
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea

C     D   A#
Im anemic royalty


Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally

Im so tired I cant sleep
Im a liar and a thief
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Im anemic royalty

Im on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids

(End on Am)


Tips:  Slide up fron the C barre to the D barre during the 
chorus.  During the verse, play F# G E on the low E string as 
the change between the G and Am.


     E A D G B e
Am   x 0 2 2 1 0
G    3 2 0 0 0 3
C    x 3 5 5 5 3
D    x 5 7 7 7 5
A#   x 1 3 3 3 1
