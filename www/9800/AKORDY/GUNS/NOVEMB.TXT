November Rain
Guns N' Roses

E                        C#m
When I look into your eyes
                 B
I can see a love restrained
E                  C#m
But darlin' when I hold you
                          B
Don't you know I feel the same
       C#m           F#
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
                            B
And we both know hearts can change
C#m                     F#
And it's hard to hold a candle
                     B
In the cold November rain
C#m                            F#
We've been through this such a long long time
                        B
Just tryin' to kill the pain
    C#m                
But lovers always come and lovers always go
F#                                          B
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today

Walking away
   C#m      
If we could take the time

to lay it on the line
        F#
I could rest my head
                           B
Just knowin' that you were mine

All mine
   E              C#m
So if you want to love me
                   B
then darlin' don't refrain
E                   C#m
Or I'll just end up walkin'
                     B
In the cold November rain
       E                        F#
Do you need some time...on your own
       E                      F#
Do you need some time...all alone
          E
Everybody needs some time...
F#
on their own
                   E                      F#
Don't you know you need some time...all alone
Ebm         E               B
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
Ebm       E                   C#m
When even friends seem out to harm you
Ebm    E                C#m
But if you could heal a broken heart
Ebm      E              F#
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
            E                      F#
Sometimes I need some time...on my own
            E                      F#
Sometimes I need some time...all alone
          E      
Everybody needs some time...
         F#
on their own
                   E                      F#
Don't you know you need some time...all alone

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain
I know that you can love me                    {just use the chords from
When there's no one left to blame               the beginning verse here
So never mind the darkness                      also...  No big changes }
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain
