</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This technology has been developed by British company PCME. It is based on the well known principle of direct voltage induction on the "electrode" by means of charges carried by solid particulates. Contribution of electrodynamic technology lays most of all in new way of signal processing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Classic triboelectric instruments monitor voltage on the electrode created by electrical charges. These instruments are sensitive to moisture, electrode sediments and other influences do not allowing more accurate measurement. With difference to triboelectric instruments, electrodynamic methode is based on noise analysis of alternating signal component on the electrode. Alternating component is produced by charges of particulates colliding with or passing by the electrode. In such a way analyzed noise spectrum on the electrode is independent of virtually all real disturbing influences and therefore allows very accurate measurement. Shape of electrode does not have to be classic rode, there are electrodes in the shape of short stud or ring electrodes built into piping. Instruments have linear response from extremely low up to extremely high particulates concentrations. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Electrodynamic instruments series begins with the simplest types designed for filters control monitoring and continues with more complicated and accurate instruments suitable for emission applications. </P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many applications hot gases with high dust load monitoring is required. Typical applications are cement rotary kilns, magnesium plants, metallurgy of iron and non-iron metals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Temperatures can reach up to 1400°C and dust particulates concentration can be in the range of hundreds of grams per cubic meter. Mechanically cleaned, automatically controlled cooled probes are usually used for these applications. However, despite high price they offer only limited reliability. Customers usually fight with permanent problems with probe and filters clogging.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ECM offers to its customers elegant solution. Special, water cooled probe with the length up to 4 m, resistant to temperatures up to 1400°C is installed directly on the sampling site. Sample is drawn to the probe via fine orifice created by water spraying. Water spraying is caused by a small orifice mounted on the probe inlet. Due to water spraying the sample is drawn into the probe in the form of gas bubbles together with water mixed with solid particulates. Stream movement is provided by water ejector pump, where the sample flows through two filter assemblies for elimination of solid particulates from water mixture. Sample bubbler serves for corrosive componets elimination from the sample before analysis. Gas/water separation in the sample is provided by a condensation dryer. Dry gaseous sample is after filtration analyzed by conventional analyzers. Effective probe back purge cleaning system allows for attendance free monitoring system operation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Safe operation even under extreme conditions as well as attractive price certainly pleasently surprise customers having experience with complicated and costly systems for these applications. Reliability of this solution has been proved by more than 50 reference installations all over the Europe.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are sure, that you will have in connection with this revolutionary solution many questions, which we will gladly respond to. Our experts will provide you with any other required information. We are again looking forward to your enquires, which we will react as soon as possible to. </P>
